# Federated-Learning-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System
FL-based intrusion detection system development using model averaging.

# Requirements
This project is developed based on Python 3.6, Keras 2.3.1, numpy 1.21.5.

# Reference
Hope our work or this repo is useful for your research. In addition, we proposed a work based on semi-supervised federated learning for intrusion detection:
